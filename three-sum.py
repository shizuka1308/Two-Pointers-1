# The code fixes one number (nums[i]) and uses a hashmap to find two numbers that sum to -nums[i], 
# ensuring unique triplets by storing results in a set. Sorting the array helps handle duplicates efficiently.
# Time Complexity: O(NÂ²) (We iterate N times and do an O(N) lookup per loop).
# Space Complexity: O(N) (For storing values in hashMap and results in set()).
